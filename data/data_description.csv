column_name,description
quality,a measure of the quality of the recorded video.
bits,number of bits used to encode that block in the video stream.
intra_parts,number sub-blocks inside this block that are not encoded by making use of information in other frames.
skip_parts,number sub-blocks inside this block that are straight-forward copied from another frame.
inter_16x16_parts,number of sub-blocks inside this block making use of information in other frames and whose size is 16x16 pixels.
inter_4x4_parts,number of sub-blocks inside this block making use of information in other frames and whose size is 4x4 pixels.
inter_other_parts,number of sub-blocks inside this block making use of information in other frames and whose size is different from 16x16 and 4x4 pixels.
non_zero_pixels,number of pixels different from 0 after encoding the block.
frame_width,the width of the video frame in pixels.

mean,mean of the pixels of the encoded block.
sub_mean_1,mean of the pixels contained in the first 32x32 sub-bock of the current block.
sub_mean_2,mean of the pixels contained in the second 32x32 sub-bock of the current block.
sub_mean_3,mean of the pixels contained in the third 32x32 sub-bock of the current block.
sub_mean_4,mean of the pixels contained in the fourth 32x32 sub-bock of the current block.
var_sub_blocks,variance of the four previous values.
sobel_h,mean of the pixels of the encoded block after applying the Sobel operator in horizontal direction.

variance,variance of the pixels of the encoded block.
block_movement_h,a measure of the movement of the current block in the horizontal direction.
block_movement_v,a measure of the movement of the current block in the vertical direction.
var_movement_h,a measure of the variance of the movements inside the current block in the horizontal direction.
var_movement_v,a measure of the variance of the movements inside the current block in the vertical direction.
cost_1,a measure of the cost of encoding this block without partitioning it.
cost_2,a measure of the cost of encoding this block without partitioning it and without considering any movement in it.
relevant,the target variable that indicates whether the current block is relevant (1) or not (0)
